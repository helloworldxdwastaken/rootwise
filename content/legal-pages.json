While we strive for accuracy and safety, AI systems:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>May occasionally produce incomplete or inaccurate information</li>\n    <li>Cannot replace human clinical judgment</li>\n    <li>Should be viewed as a starting point for further research and professional consultation</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h2>No Warranties or Guarantees</h2>\n  <p>Rootwise provides information \"as is\" without warranties of any kind.
