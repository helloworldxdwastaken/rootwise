# How Rootwise Works

**Listen to your body. We help you respond gently.**

Rootwise is here to make exploring natural wellness feel easy, safe, and deeply personal. No overwhelming research. No extreme diets. No miracle promises. Just calm, thoughtful suggestions tailored to how *you* feel right now.

---

## The Rootwise Approach in 4 Steps

### 1️⃣ Tell Us How You're Feeling

Start with a simple conversation. No forms, no medical jargon—just you, in your own words.

**Examples:**
- "I have a dull headache and my neck feels tense."
- "I want to sleep better and wake up feeling rested."
- "I've been bloated after eating bread lately."

Rootwise listens the way a caring practitioner would. We ask a couple of gentle follow-up questions to understand context—like when it started, what makes it better or worse, and whether there are any safety concerns we should keep in mind (medications, allergies, red flags).

**Why we ask questions:**  
A few thoughtful questions help us avoid generic advice and give you suggestions that actually fit your life. It also helps us surface safety notes tailored to your situation.

### 2️⃣ AI Interprets Your Story (Without Diagnosing)

Behind the scenes, Rootwise uses artificial intelligence to:
- Turn your everyday language into structured wellness insights
- Match your input to gentle, evidence-informed suggestions
- Keep safety front and center

**Important:** Rootwise does **not** diagnose conditions or replace medical advice. Think of it as a knowledgeable friend who's read a lot about nutrition, herbs, and daily habits—but always reminds you to check with your doctor when needed.

### 4️⃣ Your Body Profile Remembers What Matters

Rootwise quietly builds a lightweight **body profile** that remembers:

- Preferred languages and tone
- Past patterns and notes

This means every new session is smarter and safer—without you repeating yourself.

## Fast Experiments: Evidence-Informed Body Hacks

Rootwise sometimes suggests **quick, low-risk experiments** inspired by wellness research. These are not medical treatments—they're gentle practices some people find helpful.

### Examples:

**Contrast Hydrotherapy for Tension Relief**  
Alternating warm and cool water on tense muscles may help circulation and relaxation. (Always test temperature safely; avoid extremes.)

**Box Breathing for Stress Response**  
Breathe in for 4 counts, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4. Repeat. This simple technique may help activate your parasympathetic nervous system.

**Oral Rehydration Concepts**  
Adding a pinch of salt and a squeeze of lemon to water mimics oral rehydration solutions, which may help with hydration, especially after exertion or mild dehydration.

**Important:** These suggestions are educational and exploratory—not prescriptions. If something feels wrong, stop and consult a professional.
