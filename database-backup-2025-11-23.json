A headache that lasts for over a week can be concerning, and it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for proper evaluation and guidance.\n\nThat being said, there are several potential causes for a persistent headache. Some possible explanations include:\n\n- Tension headaches: These are the most common type of headache and can be caused by muscle tension in the neck and scalp.\n- Migraines: These can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetics, hormonal changes, and sensitivity to certain foods or environmental triggers.\n- Sinus pressure: If you have a sinus infection or allergies, it can cause sinus pressure and headaches.\n- Medication overuse: Taking pain medication too frequently or in high doses can lead to rebound headaches.\n- Dehydration: Not drinking enough water can cause headaches.\n- Sleep disorders: Poor sleep quality, insomnia, or sleep apnea can lead to headaches.\n- Nutritional deficiencies: Deficiencies in magnesium, vitamin B2, or other nutrients can contribute to headaches.\n\nResearch suggests that staying hydrated, practicing stress-reducing techniques, and maintaining a consistent sleep schedule may help alleviate headache symptoms.\n\nIn the meantime, you might explore some gentle relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga, to help manage stress and alleviate headache symptoms.\n\nHowever, please consult with a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying conditions that may require medical attention.\n\nSome red flags to watch out for include:\n\n- Sudden, severe headache\n- Headache with fever, confusion, or stiff neck\n- Headache with weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking\n- Headache that worsens over time or is accompanied by vomiting\n\nIf you experience any of these, please seek immediate medical care.\n\nThis is educational information to discuss with your provider.",
